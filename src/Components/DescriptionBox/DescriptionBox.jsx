                    E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, revolutionizes the way we buy and sell goods and services
                    by conducting transactions over the internet. It encompasses a vast array of online activities, from
                    retail sites like Amazon and Alibaba to digital marketplaces such as eBay and Etsy, offering
                    unparalleled convenience and global reach. E-commerce facilitates seamless transactions, enabling
                    consumers to browse, compare, and purchase products from the comfort of their homes or on the go
                    through mobile devices. With its ever-expanding scope, encompassing everything from digital
                    downloads to physical goods delivery, e-commerce continues to reshape the landscape of modern
                    commerce, driving innovation and transforming traditional business models.
